             A company profile is a professional summary of the business and its activities. You need a company profile if you want to raise capital and win investors, but you can also use it to inform other stakeholders, including clients. You will find many variations and lengths for a company profile. Some businesses may not have grown enough yet and have profiles that are just two pages long.
